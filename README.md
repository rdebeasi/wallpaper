# Wallpaper

Collection of simple backgrounds, mostly photos of nature. Inspired by [elementary OS Wallpapers](https://github.com/elementary/wallpapers).

## Guidelines

Photos should...

- Be at least 4K resolution (3840 x 2160).
- Not focus on people, animals, or food. There's nothing wrong with these subjects, but they can be distracting in a wallpaper. :slight_smile:
